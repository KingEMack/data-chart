          <p> When Covid-19 started to peak many commuters took a break from public transportation of all forms to ensure their safety. As New Yorkers abided by the mandatory stay at home order uber ridership began to decline with non-essential
            businesses and nightlife attractions being closed. </p>
          <p><iframe title="Percentage Change in Uber Rides per Month in NYC" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3hHq7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3hHq7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
              style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe>
            <script type="text/javascript">
              ! function() {
                "use strict";
                window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
                  if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                    for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                      var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                      t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
                    }
                }))
              }();
            </script>
          </p>
          <p> According to Uber ridership data, the first decline is shown in March with a decrease of 43% which is also when the city was first shut down. This was followed by the greatest decline in April with a decrease of 80%. </p>

          <p> William Newman, a Brooklyn-Based Uber Driver said, “I used to be able to complete 100 to 200 rides in one week, but due to the pandemic and new safety procedures my rides have drastically decreased. I actually started to reject rides
            because the pick-up locations were too far and although the number of rides I receive is growing the business is still not the same.” </p>
